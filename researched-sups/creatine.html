          How much water should I be drinking when taking creatine?
        </h2>
        <p class="selected-supplement-text">
          Per Serving: It's recommended to drink about 12-17 ounces of water along with a typical 3-5 gram serving of creatine <a href="https://www.transparentlabs.com/blogs/all/how-much-water-to-drink-with-creatine">(5)</a>
          <br><br>
          Daily Total: It's recommended to drink about 102 - 136 ounces of water per day while actively taking creatine. This helps manage the increase in water retention within your muscles due to creatine and supports overall hydration

        <h2 class="question-header">Do I Need "Load" Creatine?</h2>
        <p class="selected-supplement-text">
          It's not necessary to load creatine. The "loading" phase involves taking a high dose—typically 15-20 grams per day for 5-7 days—to quickly saturate the muscles with creatine. This is followed by a reduced daily maintenance dose of about 5 grams. Although loading can help you experience the effects of creatine sooner, it's not essential.
          <br><br>
          You can simply take 5 grams daily from the start, which will yield the same benefits over a longer period without the potential for side effects like stomach discomfort or increased water retention that can accompany the loading phase.
        </p>

        <h2 class="question-header">Who Should Not Supplement Creatine?</h2>
        <p class="selected-supplement-text" style="margin-bottom: 100px;">
          Creatine is widely used and considered safe for most people, but there are some individuals who should avoid it or consult with a healthcare provider before starting supplementation:
          <br><br>
          People with Kidney Disease: Those with pre-existing kidney conditions or reduced kidney function should be cautious, as creatine can potentially increase the workload on the kidneys.
          <br><br>
          People with Liver Disease: Since creatine is metabolized by the liver, those with liver conditions should also consult their doctor before using creatine supplements.
          <br><br>
          Diabetics: Creatine may affect blood sugar levels, so individuals with diabetes should monitor their blood sugar closely if they choose to use creatine.
